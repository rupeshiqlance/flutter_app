# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: VisbyRoundCF
       fonts:
        - asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-DemiBold.otf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-Regular.otf
          weight: 100
        - asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-Medium.otf
          weight: 300
      #- asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-ExtraBold.otf
      #- asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-ExtraLight.otf
      #- asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-Heavy.otf
      #- asset: fonts/VisbyRoundCF-Light.otf
